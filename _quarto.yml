abstract:
  We introduce a methodology for coding Bayesian statistical models in Python with JAX that follows the design pattern of the Stan probabilistic programming language.  This allows a direct, line-by-line translation into JAX of all of the courses, texts, and case studies for Stan across the physical, biological, and social sciences, engineering, business, health, education, policy, economics, and sports, as well as providing a transparent framework for further model development.  State-of-the-art algorithms require first or second derivatives of an unnormalized log posterior density. Coupled with modern hardware (e.g., multi-core, GPU, and TPU), compiled JAX far exceeds the efficiency and scalabilty of Stan.  JAX's implementation of NumPy and SciPy, TensorFlow (including TensorFlow Probability), and DeepMind Distrax provide a wider range of special function support than Stan. The package ArviZ provides the same posterior analysis tools as Stan, Blackjax provides a wider range of inference algorithms, and TensorFlow Probability provides a wider range of variable transforms.  Together, these tools provide an environment to code models in the style of Stan for modern hardware without sacrificing the benefits of a Python integrated programming environment.
